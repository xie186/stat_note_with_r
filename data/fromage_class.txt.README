The 4th group corresponds to the “fresh cheeses”.
The 3rh to the “soft cheeses”.
The 2nd to the “hard cheeses”.
The 1st is a bit the “catch all” group.
My skills about cheese stop there (thanks to Wikipedia).
For characterization using the variables, it is necessary to
go through univariate (easy to read and interpret) or
multivariate statistical techniques (which take into account
the relationships between variables).
