["mrg.html", "3 MRG 3.1 Read the data", " 3 MRG Sir Francis Galton (1822–1911) was an English statistician. He founded many concepts in statistics, such as correlation, quartile, percentile and regression, that are still being used today. 3.1 Read the data Consider the data collected by Francis Galton in the 1880s, stored in a modern format in the galton.csv file. In this file, heights is the variable containing the child’s heights, while the father’s and mother’s height is contained in the variables father and mother. The family variable is a numerical code identifying children in the same family; the number of kids in this family is in nkids. ## Data from https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python/blob/master/ISP/Code_Quantlets/08_TestsMeanValues/anovaOneway/galton.csv tab&lt;-read.csv(&quot;data/galton.csv&quot;) head(tab) ## family father mother sex height nkids ## 1 1 78.5 67.0 M 73.2 4 ## 2 1 78.5 67.0 F 69.2 4 ## 3 1 78.5 67.0 F 69.0 4 ## 4 1 78.5 67.0 F 69.0 4 ## 5 2 75.5 66.5 M 73.5 4 ## 6 2 75.5 66.5 M 72.5 4 Check the number of rows and columns: dim(tab) ## [1] 898 6 Covert the column of sex into numberic values: tab$sex=as.numeric(tab$sex) -1 head(tab) ## family father mother sex height nkids ## 1 1 78.5 67.0 1 73.2 4 ## 2 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.2 4 ## 3 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.0 4 ## 4 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.0 4 ## 5 2 75.5 66.5 1 73.5 4 ## 6 2 75.5 66.5 1 72.5 4 Remove the columns of nkids: tab&lt;-tab[, -c(6)] head(tab) ## family father mother sex height ## 1 1 78.5 67.0 1 73.2 ## 2 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.2 ## 3 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.0 ## 4 1 78.5 67.0 0 69.0 ## 5 2 75.5 66.5 1 73.5 ## 6 2 75.5 66.5 1 72.5 "],

In other words, the eigenvalues explain the variance of the data along the new feature axes. 4.5.1 Covariance Matrix The classic approach to PCA is to perform the eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix \\(\\Sigma\\), which is a \\(d \\times d\\) matrix where each element represents the covariance between two features. The covariance between two features is calculated as follows: \\(\\sigma_{jk} = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left( x_{ij}-\\bar{x}_j \\right) \\left( x_{ik}-\\bar{x}_k \\right).\\) We can summarize the calculation of the covariance matrix via the following matrix equation: \\(\\Sigma = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\left( (\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{\\bar{x}})^T\\;(\\mathbf{X} - \\mathbf{\\bar{x}}) \\right)\\) where \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{x}}\\) is the mean vector \\(\\mathbf{\\bar{x}} = \\sum\\limits_{i=1}^n x_{i}.\\) The mean vector is a \\(d\\)-dimensional vector where each value in this vector represents the sample mean of a feature column in the dataset. ``` 4.6 References https://sebastianraschka.com/Articles/2015_pca_in_3_steps.html#about-iris How to read PCA biplots and scree plots: https://blog.bioturing.com/2018/06/18/how-to-read-pca-biplots-and-scree-plots/ Principal Component Analysis (PCA): https://learnche.org/pid/latent-variable-modelling/principal-component-analysis/index "],

There could be a non-linear relationship between predictor variables and an outcome variable and the pattern could show up in this plot if the model doesn’t capture the non-linear relationship. If you find equally spread residuals around a horizontal line without distinct patterns, that is a good indication you don’t have non-linear relationships. Normal Q-Q This plot shows if residuals are normally distributed. Do residuals follow a straight line well or do they deviate severely? It’s good if residuals are lined well on the straight dashed line. Scale-Location It’s also called Spread-Location plot. This plot shows if residuals are spread equally along the ranges of predictors. This is how you can check the assumption of equal variance (homoscedasticity). It’s good if you see a horizontal line with equally (randomly) spread points. Residuals vs Leverage This plot helps us to find influential cases (i.e., subjects) if any. Not all outliers are influential in linear regression analysis (whatever outliers mean). Even though data have extreme values, they might not be influential to determine a regression line. That means, the results wouldn’t be much different if we either include or exclude them from analysis. They follow the trend in the majority of cases and they don’t really matter; they are not influential. On the other hand, some cases could be very influential even if they look to be within a reasonable range of the values. They could be extreme cases against a regression line and can alter the results if we exclude them from analysis. Another way to put it is that they don’t get along with the trend in the majority of the cases. Unlike the other plots, this time patterns are not relevant. We watch out for outlying values at the upper right corner or at the lower right corner. Those spots are the places where cases can be influential against a regression line. Look for cases outside of a dashed line, Cook’s distance. When cases are outside of the Cook’s distance (meaning they have high Cook’s distance scores), the cases are influential to the regression results. The regression results will be altered if we exclude those cases. #install.packages(&quot;UsingR&quot;) suppressWarnings(suppressMessages(library(UsingR))) data(father.son) names(father.son) ## [1] &quot;fheight&quot; &quot;sheight&quot; model_fs = lm(fheight~sheight, father.son) par(mfrow=c(2,2)) # Change the panel layout to 2 x 2 plot(model_fs) 6.2 summary(model2) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = Ozone ~ Solar.R * Wind, data = airquality) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -48.694 -17.200 -4.384 12.740 78.218 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.
