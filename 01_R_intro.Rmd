## Data structures



R has multiple data structures. If you are familiar with excel you can think of data structures as building blocks of a table and the table itself, and a table is similar to a sheet in excel. Most of the time you will deal with tabular data sets, you will manipulate them, take sub-sections of them. It is essential to know what are the common data structures in R and how they can be used. R deals with named data structures, this means you can give names to data structures and manipulate or operate on them using those names.
