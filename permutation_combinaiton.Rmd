# Permutation and combination

As a matter of fact, a permutation is an ordered combination. There are basically two types of permutations, with repetition (or replacement) and without repetition (without replacement).


```{r}
require(combinat)
permn(3)
combn(3, 2)
```

```{r}
length(permn(3))
dim(combn(3,2))[2]
```
