## Read the data

Consider the data collected by Francis Galton in the 1880s, stored in a modern format in the `galton.csv` file. In this file, `heights` is the variable containing the child’s heights, while the `father`’s and `mother`’s height is contained in the variables father and mother.
The family variable is a numerical code identifying children in the same family; the number of kids in this family is in `nkids`.



```{r}
## Data from  https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python/blob/master/ISP/Code_Quantlets/08_TestsMeanValues/anovaOneway/galton.csv
tab<-read.csv("data/galton.csv")
head(tab)
```



## Line plot

## Basic line plot

```{r}
plot(tab$father, tab$height)
```


## Color the dots based on the `sex` information

```{r}
col_info = ifelse(tab$sex=="M", "royalblue", "darkred")
plot(tab$father, tab$height, col=col_info)
```


```{r}
col_info = ifelse(tab$sex=="M", "royalblue", "darkred")
plot(tab$father, tab$height, col=col_info, xlim=c(60, 80), ylim=c(60, 80))
legend(76, 65,pch=c(19,19),col=c("royalblue", "darkred"),c("female", "male"),bty="o",cex=.8)

```
