# Linear model


While the assumtions of a linear model are never perfectly met, we must still check if they are reasonable assumtions to work with. 



## 



```{r}
## Data from  https://github.com/thomas-haslwanter/statsintro_python/blob/master/ISP/Code_Quantlets/08_TestsMeanValues/anovaOneway/galton.csv
tab<-read.csv("data/galton.csv")
head(tab)
```

## Extract male data 

```{r}
tab_son = tab[tab$sex=="M", ]
head(tab_son)
plot(father~height, data=tab_son)
```
